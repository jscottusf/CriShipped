**CriShipped** is a full-stack web application that incorporates front-end user friendly technologies with a complete back-end server to support itself. It is a website that connects users in need of crisis-related goods to users who have those goods. It is also a community resource page that contains local crisis updates, news, user profiles and a forum, to connect all users during unprecidented cirtical times.

### Viewing the site from the back-end:

In order to see the site functioning with the server, for developmental purposes, the viewer would have to install MongoDB locally. Below is a link to install MongoDB, with implemenation instructions from [Zell Liew](https://zellwk.com/blog) Blog.

[MongoDB - Click here to download (Mac or Windows)](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs_americas_united%20states_search_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=download%20mongodb&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&gclid=CjwKCAjw4KD0BRBUEiwA7MFNTS9fWMoVoGhexjP11iqCEL8Xptq2MTCuosWb1ic07twCX0opJz3nDRoCb0sQAvD_BwE)

### Future Development Ideas for the site:

- Implementing a mobile-hybrid framework
- Having the site verify and rate all sellers
- Off-loading the User Authentication externally to Amazon Web Services Cognito, to support sign-in with social identity providers and enterprise identity providers, for easier and quicker sign-on and more security for the users purchases
- Creating a more in-depth forum with drop down menu options and more specific fields
- Adding actual payments methods into the site for true purchases
- More shopping cart functionality with actual real-time products being offered
